/* Basic idea of BINARY SEARCH

* In Binary Search, the idea of the algorithm is to DIVIDE & CONQUER,
reducing the search area by half each time, trying to find a target number...

    *in order to leverage this power however, our array must firt be SORTED,
    else we cannot make assumptions about the array's contents..
